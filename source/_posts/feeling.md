#### Just boring so write something

  Lately I was troubled by my computer, for its small volume after installed xcode,I almost can't work,and today I bought CleanMyMac, actually I installed it before,which is the free one and had no effect at all, instead, the bought one is incredibly effective, release my mac almost double usable volume,it's really awesome,and make it possible to install the software ps.I can learn some ps skill in my leisure time.Learning is great and full of joy.Happy~~

  I'm always thinking about updating my blog style(the format is so awful),but as always have no time,there is so much things to do,and time is so fast.So much to learn but have no that much of time.Horrible~~

#### New skill get(get dimensions automately through ps and zeplin)

  1、Install ps;
  2、Install zeplin;
  3、Link zeplin with ps;[here is official tutorial](https://support.zeplin.io/photoshop-integration/installing-photoshop-plugin-on-mac)
  3、Make it work: [this one is helpful](https://support.zeplin.io/photoshop-integration/working-with-artboards-in-photoshop)
  4、And you can use this way to get dimension to write your website.

Actually there exists better software than ps to do this,like sketch,but for my computer's poor memory,I just use ps to do this,thankful zeplin supports it.

#### There are so many awesome softwares to save our time.

 Today's homework is still delay,it's late in night again, and I am so sleepy that my eye can't open. Actually every day is sleepy,I need more more more sleep~~~
